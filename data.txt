        "description": "When Aretha Franklin left Columbia Records for Atlantic in 1966, the label\u2019s vice president, Jerry Wexler, came to the singer with some suggestions for songs she might cover, like Sam Cooke\u2019s \u201cA Change Is Gonna Come\u201d and Ray Charles\u2019 \u201cDrown in My Own Tears.\u201d She liked those ideas, but she had one of her own: \u201cRespect,\u201d a song she\u2019d been performing live. \u201cLong as she changes it up,\u201d Wexler told Franklin\u2019s manager Ted White in an exchange recounted by Franklin\u2019s biographer David Ritz. \u201cYou don\u2019t gotta worry about that,\u201d White responded. \u201cShe changes it up all right.\u201d Otis Redding wrote \u201cRespect\u201d and recorded it for the Stax/Volt label in 1965. But Franklin took possession of the song for all time with her definitive cover, cut at Atlantic\u2019s New York studio on Valentine\u2019s Day 1967. \u201cRespect\u201d was her first Number One hit and the single that established her as the Queen of Soul. In Redding\u2019s reading, a brawny march, he called for equal favor with volcanic force. Franklin wasn\u2019t asking for anything. She sang from higher ground: a woman calling for an end to the exhaustion and sacrifice of a raw deal with scorching sexual authority. In short: If you want some, you will earn it. \u201cFor Otis, \u2018respect\u2019 had the traditional connotation, the more abstract meaning of esteem,\u201d Wexler said in his autobiography, Rhythm and the Blues: A Life in American Music. \u201cThe fervor in Aretha\u2019s magnificent voice demanded that respect and more: Respect also involved sexual attention of the highest order. What else could \u2018Sock it to me\u2019 mean?\u201d He was referring to the knockout sound of Franklin\u2019s backup singers \u2014 her sisters, Carolyn and Erma \u2014 chanting \u201cSock it to me\u201d at high speed, which Aretha and Carolyn cooked up for the session. The late Tom Dowd, who engineered the date, credited Carolyn with the saucy breakdown in which Aretha spelled out the title: \u201cI fell off my chair when I heard that!\u201d And since Redding\u2019s version had no bridge, Wexler had the band \u2014 the legendary studio crew from Muscle Shoals, Alabama \u2014 play the chord changes from Sam and Dave\u2019s \u201cWhen Something Is Wrong With My Baby\u201d under King Curtis\u2019 tenor-sax solo. There is no mistaking the passion inside the discipline of Franklin\u2019s delivery; she was surely drawing on her own tumultuous marriage at the time for inspiration. \u201cIf she didn\u2019t live it,\u201d Wexler said, \u201cshe couldn\u2019t give it.\u201d But, he added, \u201cAretha would never play the part of the scorned woman.\u2026 Her middle name was Respect.\u201d Leading off her Atlantic debut, I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You, \u201cRespect\u201d catalyzed rock & roll, gospel, and blues to create the model for soul music that artists still look to today (Mariah Carey called Franklin \u201cmy mentor\u201d). Just as important, the song\u2019s unapologetic demands resonated powerfully with the civil rights movement and emergent feminist revolution, fitting for an artist who donated to the Black Panther Party and sang at the funeral of Martin Luther King Jr. In her 1999 memoir, Franklin wrote that the song reflected \u201cthe need of the average man and woman in the street, the businessman, the mother, the fireman, the teacher \u2014 everyone wanted respect.\u201d We still do.",

Before going into Columbia Records\u2019 New York studios to cut it, Dylan summoned Mike Bloomfield, the guitarist in the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, to Woodstock to learn the song. \u201cHe said, \u2018I don\u2019t want you to play any of that B.B.

The fidelity was abysmal. Vig \u2014 about to work with Nirvana on their major-label debut, Nevermind \u2014 could not tell that the song would soon make underground Seattle rock the new mainstream and catapult Cobain, a troubled young man with strict indie-culture ethics, into mega-celebrity. \u201cI could sort of hear the \u2018Hello, hello\u2019 part and the chords,\u201d Vig said years later. \u201cBut it was so indecipherable that I had no idea what to expect.\u201d \u201cTeen Spirit\u201d was Cobain\u2019s attempt to \u201cwrite the ultimate pop song,\u201d he said, using the soft-loud dynamic of his favorite band, the Pixies.

In 1970, Marvin Gaye was Motown\u2019s top male vocal star, yet he was frustrated by the assembly-line role he played on his own hits. Devastated by the loss of duet partner Tammi Terrell, who died that March after a three-year battle with a brain tumor, Gaye was also trapped in a turbulent marriage to Anna Gordy, Motown boss Berry Gordy\u2019s sister. Gaye was tormented, too, by his relationship with his puritanical father, Marvin Sr. \u201cIf I was arguing for peace,\u201d Gaye told biographer David Ritz, \u201cI knew I\u2019d have to find peace in my heart.\u201d Not long after Terrell\u2019s passing, Renaldo Benson of the Four Tops presented Gaye with a song he had written with Motown staffer Al Cleveland. But Gaye made the song his own, overseeing the arrangement and investing the topical references to war and racial strife with private anguish. Motown session crew the Funk Brothers cut the stunning, jazz-inflected rhythm track (Gaye joined in with cardboard-box percussion). Then Gaye invoked his own family in moving prayer: singing to his younger brother Frankie, a Vietnam veteran (\u201cBrother, brother, brother/There\u2019s far too many of you dying\u201d), and appealing for calm closer to home (\u201cFather, father, father/We don\u2019t need to escalate\u201d).

        "description": "\"I wrote it. I didn't fail. It was straight,\" Bob Dylan said of his greatest song shortly after he recorded it in June 1965. There is no better description of \"Like a Rolling Stone\" \u2014 of its revolutionary design and execution \u2014 or of the young man, just turned 24, who created it.Al Kooper, who played organ on the session, remembers today, \"There was no sheet music, it was totally by ear. And it was totally disorganized, totally punk. It just happened.\"The most stunning thing about \"Like a Rolling Stone\" is how unprecedented it was: the impressionist voltage of Dylan's language, the intensely personal accusation in his voice (\"Ho-o-o-ow does it fe-e-e-el?\"), the apocalyptic charge of Kooper's garage-gospel organ and Mike Bloomfield's stiletto-sharp spirals of Telecaster guitar, the defiant six-minute length of the June 16th master take. No other pop song has so thoroughly challenged and transformed the commercial laws and artistic conventions of its time, for all time.Just a few weeks earlier, as he was finishing up the British tour immortalized in D.A. Pennebaker's documentary Don't Look Back, Dylan began writing an extended piece of verse \u2014 20 pages long by one account, six in another \u2014 that was, he said, \"just a rhythm thing on paper all about my steady hatred, directed at some point that was honest.\" Back home in Woodstock, New York, over three days in early June, Dylan sharpened the sprawl down to that confrontational chorus and four taut verses bursting with piercing metaphor and concise truth. \"The first two lines, which rhymed 'kiddin' you' and 'didn't you,' just about knocked me out,\" he confessed to Rolling Stone in 1988, \"and when I got to the jugglers and the chrome horse and the princess on the steeple, it all just about got to be too much.\"The beginnings of \"Like a Rolling Stone\" can be seen in a pair of offstage moments in Don't Look Back. In the first, sidekick Bob Neuwirth gets Dylan to sing a verse of Hank Williams' \"Lost Highway,\" which begins, \"I'm a rolling stone, I'm alone and lost/For a life of sin I've paid the cost.\" Later, Dylan sits at a piano, playing a set of chords that would become the melodic basis for \"Like a Rolling Stone,\" connecting it to the fundamental architecture of rock & roll. Dylan later identified that progression as a chip off of Ritchie Valens' \"La Bamba.\"Yet Dylan obsessed over the forward march in \"Like a Rolling Stone.\" Before going into Columbia Records' New York studios to cut it, he summoned Bloomfield, the guitarist in the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, to Woodstock to learn the song. \"He saidI don't want you to play any of that B.B. King shit, none of that fucking blues,'\u2009\" recalled Bloomfield (who died in 1981). \"\u2009'I want you to play something else.'\u2009\" Dylan later said much the same thing to the rest of the studio band, which included pianist Paul Griffin, bassist Russ Savakus and drummer Bobby Gregg: \"I told them how to play on it, and if they didn't want to play it like that, well, they couldn't play with me.\"Just as Dylan bent folk music's roots and forms to his own will, he transformed popular song with the content and ambition of \"Like a Rolling Stone.\" And in his electrifying vocal performance, his best on record, Dylan proved that everything he did was, first and always, rock & roll. \"\u2009'Rolling Stone'\u2009's the best song I wrote,\" he said flatly at the end of 1965. It still is.",

        "description": " \"It's the riff heard round the world,\" says Steve Van Zandt, guitarist for the E Street Band. \"And it's one of the earliest examples of Dylan influencing the Stones and the Beatles \u2014 the degree of cynicism, and the idea of bringing more personal lyrics from the folk and blues tradition into popular music.\"The riff came to Keith Richards in a dream one night in May 1965, in his motel room in Clearwater, Florida, on the Rolling Stones' third U.S. tour. He woke up and grabbed a guitar and a cassette machine. Richards played the run of notes once, then fell back to sleep. \"On the tape,\" he said later, \"you can hear me drop the pick, and the rest is snoring.\"That spark in the night \u2014 the riff that opens and defines \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\" \u2014 transformed the rickety jump and puppy love of early rock & roll into rock. The primal temper of Richards' creation, played through a Gibson Fuzz Box; the sneering dismissal in Mick Jagger's lyrics; the strut of rhythm guitarist Brian Jones, bassist Bill Wyman and drummer Charlie Watts: It was the sound of a generation impatient to inherit the Earth.Two decades later, Jagger admitted that \"Satisfaction\" was \"my view of the world, my frustration with everything.\" Inspired by that riff and the title line, also Richards' idea, Jagger wrote the words \u2014 a litany of disgust with \"America, its advertising syndrome, the constant barrage\" \u2014 in 10 minutes, by the motel pool the day after Richards' dream. They tried to cut the song a few days later, on May 10th at the Chess studios in Chicago. Two days after that, they finished it at RCA Studios in Hollywood, with the vital addition of that fuzz. \"That riff needed to sustain itself,\" Richards said, \"and Gibson had just brought out these little boxes.\"\"Satisfaction\" was rock of the Stones' own bold design \u2014 although Richards may also have been dreaming of Chuck Berry that night in Clearwater. Jagger later suggested that Richards unconsciously got the hook for \"Satisfaction\" from a line in Berry's 1955 single \"30 Days\"\u00e2\u20ac\u02c6(\"I don't get no satisfaction from the judge\"). \"It's not any way an English person would express it,\" Jagger noted. \"I'm not saying that he purposely nicked anything, but we played those records a lot.\"",

        "description": "John Lennon wrote \"Imagine,\" his greatest musical gift to the world, one morning early in 1971 in his bedroom at Tittenhurst Park, his estate in Ascot, England. His wife, Yoko Ono, watched as Lennon sat at the white grand piano now known around the world from films and photographs of the sessions for his Imagine album and virtually completed the song: the serene melody; the pillowy chord progression; that beckoning, four-note figure; and nearly all of the lyrics, 22 lines of graceful, plain-spoken faith in the power of a world, united in purpose, to repair and change itself.\"It's not like he thoughtOh, this can be an anthem,'\" Ono said, looking back at that morning 30 years later. \"Imagine\" was \"just what John believed: that we are all one country, one world, one people. He wanted to get that idea out.\"The idea was not his alone: Ono's own art, before and after she met Lennon in 1966, celebrated the transformative power of dreams. The first line of \"Imagine\" \u2014 \"Imagine there's no heaven\" \u2014 is a direct descendant of the interactive pieces in Ono's 1964 book, Grapefruit (\"Imagine letting a goldfish swim across the sky\"). But Lennon, as a former Beatle, was an expert in the pop vernacular. He once admitted that \"Imagine\" \u2014 an absolute equality created by the dissolution of governments, borders, organized religion and economic class \u2014 was \"virtually the Communist Manifesto.\" But the elementary beauty of his melody, the warm composure in his voice and the poetic touch of co-producer Phil Spector \u2014 who bathed Lennon's performance in gentle strings and summer-breeze echo \u2014 emphasized the song's fundamental humanity.Lennon knew he had written something special. In one of his last interviews, he declared \"Imagine\" to be as good as anything he had written with the Beatles. We know it's better than that: an enduring hymn of solace and promise that has carried us through extreme grief, from the shock of Lennon's own death in 1980 to the unspeakable horror of September 11th. It is now impossible to imagine a world without \"Imagine.\" And we need it, more than he ever dreamed.",

        "description": "\"What's Going On\" is an exquisite plea for peace on Earth, sung by a man at the height of crisis. In 1970, Marvin Gaye was Motown's top male vocal star, yet he was frustrated by the assembly-line role he played on his own hits. Devastated by the loss of duet partner Tammi Terrell, who died that March after a three-year battle with a brain tumor, Gaye was also trapped in a turbulent marriage to Anna Gordy, Motown boss Berry Gordy's sister. Gaye was tormented, too, by his relationship with his puritanical father, Marvin Sr. \"If I was arguing for peace,\" Gaye told biographer David Ritz, \"I knew I'd have to find peace in my heart.\"Not long after Terrell's passing, Renaldo Benson of the Four Tops presented Gaye with a song he had written with Motown staffer Al Cleveland. But Gaye made the song his own, overseeing the arrangement and investing the topical references to war and racial strife with private anguish. Motown session crew the Funk Brothers cut the stunning, jazz-inflected rhythm track (Gaye joined in with cardboard-box percussion). Then Gaye invoked his own family in moving prayer: singing to his younger brother Frankie, a Vietnam veteran (\"Brother, brother, brother/There's far too many of you dying\"), and appealing for calm closer to home (\"Father, father, father/We don't need to escalate\").Initially rejected as uncommercial, \"What's Going On\" (with background vocals by two players from the Detroit Lions) was Gaye's finest studio achievement, a timeless gift of healing. But for Gaye, the peace he craved never came: On April 1st, 1984, he died in a family dispute \u2014 shot by his father.",

But Aretha Franklin took possession of the song for all time with her definitive cover, made at Atlantic's New York studio on Valentine's Day 1967. \"Respect\" was her first Number One hit and the single that established her as the Queen of Soul. In Redding's reading, a brawny march, he called for equal favor with volcanic force. Franklin wasn't asking for anything. She sang from higher ground: a woman calling an end to the exhaustion and sacrifice of a raw deal with scorching sexual authority. In short, if you want some, you will earn it.\"For Otis, respect had the traditional connotation, the more abstract meaning of esteem,\" Franklin's producer, Jerry Wexler, said in his autobiography, Rhythm and the Blues: A Life in American Music. \"The fervor in Aretha's voice demanded that respect; and more respect also involved sexual attention of the highest order. What else would 'Sock it to me' mean?\"He was referring to the knockout sound of Franklin's backup singers \u2014 her sisters Carolyn and Erma \u2014 chanting \"Sock it to me\" at high speed, which Aretha and Carolyn cooked up for the session. The late Tom Dowd, who engineered the date, credited Carolyn with the saucy breakdown in which Aretha spelled out the title: \"I fell off my chair when I heard that!\" And since Redding's version had no bridge, Wexler had the band \u2014 the legendary studio crew from Muscle Shoals, Alabama \u2014 play the chord changes from Sam and Dave's \"When Something Is Wrong With My Baby\" under King Curtis' tenor-sax solo.There is no mistaking the passion inside the discipline of Franklin's delivery; she was surely drawing on her own tumultuous marriage at the time for inspiration. \"If she didn't live it,\" Wexler said, \"she couldn't give it.\" But, he added, \"Aretha would never play the part of the scorned woman\u2026.Her middle name was Respect.\"",

And the same thing happened with people.\" \"Good Vibrations\" harnessed that energy and turned it into eternal sunshine. \"This is a very spiritual song,\" Wilson said after its release, \"and I want it to give off good vibrations.\"Wilson, then 24, also had another goal in mind: \"I saidThis is going to be better than \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'.'\"Wilson was still working on his long-playing magnum opus, Pet Sounds, when he started \"Good Vibrations\" late on the night of February 17th, 1966, at Gold Star Recorders in Los Angeles. During the next seven months, in four studios, at a cost of more than $50,000 (at that point the greatest sum ever spent on a single), Wilson built \"Good Vibrations\" in sections, coloring the mood swings with locomotive cello, saloon piano and the spectral wail of a theremin. \"We didn't think about doing it in pieces at first,\" Wilson says now, \"but after the first few bars in the first verse, we realized that this was going to be a different kind of record.\" Very different. Wilson \u2014 free to experiment while the other Beach Boys were on tour \u2014 could not stop wrestling with combinations of instruments and rhythmic approaches. One discarded version of the song had an R&B backbeat.\"Good Vibrations\" became the Beach Boys' third Number One hit, but it was a short window of glory \u2014 for the Beach Boys commercially, for Wilson creatively and emotionally. The song was intended to appear on the group's Smile album, but Wilson \u2014 suffering from depression and battling the other Beach Boys over the group's direction \u2014 abandoned Smile in May 1967, eventually completing the record, and performing it on tour, in 2004. \"'Good Vibrations' now is the best it's ever been,\" Wilson said that year. \"It went to Number One in 1966, and now we get standing ovations every time we play it live.

A shock wave of big-amp purity, \"Teen Spirit\" wiped the lingering jive of the Eighties off the pop map overnight. \"The song was a call to consciousness,\" Novoselic said in 2000 \u2014 Cobain's avenging grenade against the corporate invasion of youth culture, spiked with the demanding venom of the sneering chorus: \"Here we are now/Entertain us.\" The phrase was something Cobain used to say at parties \u2014 \"to break the ice,\" he said. \"That could have been him watching TV,\" said Novoselic, \"aghast at popular culture.\"\"Teen Spirit,\" named after a brand of deodorant for girls, was Cobain's attempt to \"write the ultimate pop song,\" he said, using the soft-loud dynamic of his favorite band, the Pixies. The insidious hooks also showed his admiration for John Lennon. Cobain \"had that dichotomy of punk rage and alienation,\" Vig said, \"but also this vulnerable pop sensibility. In 'Teen Spirit,' a lot of that vulnerability is in the tone of his voice.\"Sadly, by the time of Nirvana's last U.S. tour, in late '93, Cobain was tortured by the obligation to play \"Teen Spirit\" every night. \"There are many other songs that I have written that are as good, if not better,\" he claimed. He finally stopped playing \"Teen Spirit\" for good \u2014 taking his own life on April 5th, 1994.",

        "description": "\"The people just went crazy, and they loved that little ummmmh, unnnnh,\" Ray Charles told Rolling Stone in 1978, describing the instant genesis of \"What'd I Say,\" his first Top 10 pop single and the greatest feel-good song in rock & roll. \"Later on, people said it was vulgar,\" Charles continued, referring to that irresistible, sexually heated vocal bridge. \"But, hell, let's face it, everybody knows about the ummmmh, unnnnh. That's how we all got here.\"The man they called \"The Genius\" literally wrote \"What'd I Say\" in front of an audience, in late 1958 or early '59. He and his crack R&B orchestra, newly supplemented by a female vocal group, the Raelettes, were playing a marathon dance show in a small town near Pittsburgh. When Charles ran out of repertoire late in the second set, he kicked into an uphill bass-note arpeggio on the piano, told the band to follow along and instructed the Raelettes, \"Whatever I say, just repeat after me.\" Afterward, Charles said, dancers rushed up to him and asked, \"Where can I buy that record?\"\"What'd I Say\" may not have been much of a song \u2014 a handful of short, unconnected verses, the chorus and that bridge \u2014 when Charles cut it on February 18th, 1959, at Atlantic's New York studio. (The six-and-a-half-minute rave-up was masterfully edited and re-sequenced by the label's visionary engineer, Tom Dowd, from an even longer studio performance.) But out of necessity, that night on the bandstand Charles had turned to the black gospel experience he knew so well, the shared, mounting ecstasy of call-and-response. \"Church was simple,\" he said in his autobiography Brother Ray. \"Preacher sang or recited, and the congregation sang right back at him.\"That is exactly how Charles recorded \"What'd I Say,\" with a torrid secular spin heightened by the metallic attack of his Wurlitzer electric piano. Charles' grunt-'n'-groan exchanges with the Raelettes were the closest you could get to the sound of orgasm on Top 40 radio during the Eisenhower era. Forty-five years later, they still give sweet release.",

The song wasn't intended as a youth-mutiny anthem at first. It was a Jimmy Reed-style blues, reflecting Townshend's fears about the impending strictures of adult life, famously captured in the line \"Hope I die before I get old.\" \"My Generation' was very much about trying to find a place in society,\" he told Rolling Stone in 1987. \"I was very, very lost. The band was young then. It was believed that its career would be incredibly brief.\" Instead, \"My Generation\" became the Who's ticket to legend \u2014 their first British Top Five hit, and a battle cry for young mod rebels \u2014 and it established Townshend as a fearless and eloquent songwriter. \"My Generation\" went through months of arranging and rerecording before the Who got it right, in two takes, on October 13th, 1965. Townshend opened the song with a two-chord assault that beat punk rock to the punch by more than a decade. Bassist John Entwistle took the solo breaks with crisp, grunting aggression \u2014 he had to buy three new basses to finish the recording, since his Danelectro's strings kept breaking and replacement strings weren't available. (He ended up playing the song on a Fender.) Roger Daltrey's stuttering, howling performance, Townshend and Entwistle's R&B-inspired backing vocals, and the upward key changes created a vivid, mounting anxiety that climaxed with a studio re-creation of the Who's live gear-trashing finales, with Townshend spewing feedback all over Keith Moon's avalanche drumming. Four decades later, Townshend and Daltrey are all that remain of the original Who, and they still play \"My Generation\" at every show \u2014 now with the fire and wisdom of age.",

On October 8th, 1963, while on tour, Cooke and members of his entourage were arrested in Shreveport, Louisiana, for disturbing the peace after they tried to register at a white motel \u2014 an incident reflected in the song's third verse. And Cooke's mourning for his 18-month-old son, Vincent, who drowned that June, resonates in the last verse: \"There have been times that I thought/I couldn't last for long.\"On December 11th, 1964, a year after he recorded it, Cooke was fatally shot at an L.A. motel. Two weeks later, \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" was released, becoming Cooke's farewell address and an anthem of the civil rights movement.",

But McCartney's original reading \u2014 cut on June 14th, 1965, at EMI's Abbey Road studios in London \u2014 remains the most beautiful and daring of all: a frank poem of regret scored and sung with haunted elegance. There are no other Beatles on the record. None were needed. George Martin's arrangement for a string quartet emphasized lower-octave melancholy, while McCartney's almost whispered vocal reverberated with longing in the big, dark spaces where drums and electric guitars would have been. The melody, he said, came to him in a dream: \"My dad used to know a lot of old jazz tunes, I thought maybe I'd just remembered it from the past.\" McCartney auditioned the song for Martin, with the working title \"Scrambled Eggs,\" in a hotel room in Paris in January 1964 \u2014 before the Beatles had even landed in America \u2014 but would not record it for another year and a half. \"We were a little embarrassed about it,\" McCartney confessed. \"We were a rock & roll band.\" A Number One single in America, \"Yesterday\" was, in his own words, \"the most complete song I have ever written.\"",

        "description": "In April 1962, at Gerde's Folk City in New York's Greenwich Village, 20-year-old Bob Dylan gave a quick speech before playing one of his new songs: \"This here ain't no protest song or anything like thatcause I don't write no protest songs,\" he said. Then he sang the first and third verses of the still-unfinished \"Blowin' in the Wind.\" Published in full a month later in the folk journal Broadside and recorded on July 9th, 1962, for his second album, The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, \"Blowin' in the Wind\" was Dylan's first important composition. It is also the most famous protest song ever written.The Chad Mitchell Trio were the first to release a recording of it, and Peter, Paul and Mary turned it into an enormous hit in the summer of 1963. Still, everyone knew the song belonged to the burning-eyed young man who ruled New York's folk scene, and whose recording of it \u2014 just his brambly voice and fleet-fingered acoustic-guitar playing \u2014 was definitive. It probably remains Dylan's most covered song, an all-purpose progressive anthem suggesting that things must and will change. The song's melody borrows from the slavery-era folk song \"No More Auction Block for Me,\" and its language is rooted as much in Woody Guthrie's earthy vernacular as in biblical rhetoric. But in a decisive break with the current-events conventions of topical folk songs, Dylan framed the crises around him in a series of fierce, poetic questions that addressed what he believed was man's greatest inhumanity to man: indifference. \"Some of the biggest criminals are those that turn their heads away when they see wrong,\" he declared in the Freewheelin' liner notes.Later, Dylan revealed more about the mechanics of writing the song: \"I wrote 'Blowin' in the Wind' in 10 minutes, just put words to an old spiritual, probably something I learned from Carter Family records. That's the folk tradition. You use what's been handed down.\"Appears on: The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan (Columbia) ",

Around them, Britain was suffocating in crisis: soaring unemployment, racial conflict, widespread drug use. \"We felt that we were struggling,\" Joe Strummer said, \"about to slip down a slope or something, grasping with our fingernails. And there was no one there to help us.\"Strummer and guitarist Mick Jones channeled that trial and worry into a song, produced with hellbent atmosphere by Guy Stevens, that sounded like the Clash marching into battle: Strummer and Jones punching their guitars in metallic unison with Paul Simonon's thumping bass and Topper Headon's rifle-crack drumming. Over that urgency, Strummer howled through a catalog of disasters, real and imagined. The \"nuclear error\" referred to the March 1979 meltdown of a reactor at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania. The line \"London is drowning/And I live by the river\" \u2014 Don Letts' video of the Clash shows them playing the song on a boat on the Thames in drenching rain \u2014 was based on local folklore. \"They say that if the Thames ever flooded, we'd all be underwater,\" Jones said \u2014 except Strummer was living in a high-rise flat at the time, \"so he wouldn't have drowned.\"",

        "description": "As a young, struggling beat group, playing grueling gigs at grubby bars, the Beatles had an in-joke to cheer themselves up: declaring that they were going \"to the toppermost of the poppermost.\" By 1963, they meant it enough to issue an ultimatum. \"We said to [manager] Brian EpsteinWe're not going to America till we've got a Number One record,'\" Paul McCartney said. So he and John Lennon went to the home of the parents of Jane Asher, McCartney's girlfriend, where \u2014 \"one on one, eyeball to eyeball,\" as Lennon put it \u2014 they wrote \"I Want to Hold Your Hand,\" an irresistibly erotic come-on framed as a chaste, bashful request. The lightning-bolt energy of their collaboration ran through the band's performance, taped October 17th, 1963. It lunges out of the speakers with a rhythm so tricky that the first wave of bands to cover the song often couldn't figure it out; Lennon and McCartney constantly switch between unison and harmonies, both of them snapping and whooping like they own the melody. Every element of the song is a hook, from Lennon's Chuck Berry riffing to George Harrison's string-snapping guitar fills to the quartet's syncopated hand claps. With advance orders at a million copies, \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" was released in the U.K. in late November, and promptly bumped the band's own \"She Loves You\" from the top of the charts.After 15-year-old Marsha Albert convinced a Washington, D.C., DJ to seek out an imported copy of the single, it quickly became a hit on the few American stations that managed to score a copy. Rush-released in America the day after Christmas, \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" hit Number One in the States on February 1st, 1964. When the bandmates got the news in Paris, during a three-week stand there, they partied all night. The single was certified gold two days later, and four days after that, the Beatles landed in New York the way they'd wanted: toppermost of the poppermost.",

And it launched not one but two revolutions: late-Sixties psychedelia and the unprecedented genius of Jimi Hendrix. For the first time, Hendrix, bassist Noel Redding and drummer Mitch Mitchell got to show off their acrobatic onstage chemistry on record \u2014 and they somehow managed to condense it to an under-three-minute blaze of overdubbed guitar sorcery. (The first chord of its main riff has come to be known among guitarists as the \"Hendrix chord.\") The song, which Hendrix wrote on December 26th, 1966, in the dressing room of a London club, also served as a showcase for his brilliant, often contradictory lyrical gifts (boiled down from a much longer initial draft called \"Purple Haze \u2014 Jesus Saves\"). He spiked the surging rhythmic confidence of the Experience with intimate pictorial tension: \"Actin' funny, but I don't know why/'Scuse me while I kiss the sky.\" (Hendrix later said that he had written the lyrics after he'd had a dream in which he could walk underwater.) The Experience recorded \"Purple Haze\" across a series of sessions in January and February, 1967, experimenting with recording techniques such as the blitzed-out distortion on Hendrix's guitar \u2014 when the master tape was sent to their American record label, an enclosed note diligently pointed out that the distorted sound of the song was deliberate. In the closing solo, Hendrix echoed his screaming Strat with an additional shrieking guitar put through a new harmonic-manipulation device called an Octavia and played back at double speed. \"Purple Haze\" \u2014 the opening track on the U.S. version of his debut LP, Are You Experienced? \u2014 captured the liberating rush of Day-Glo culture just in time for the Summer of Love.",

        "description": "\"Hound Dog\" was a hit before Elvis Presley sang it, and he was famous for singing it before he recorded it. Written in 1952 by white teenagers Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller for R&B singer Willie Mae \"Big Mama\" Thornton, it was a smash for her, and was immediately covered by a handful of country acts. (The chorus, Leiber noted in 1987, was code for \"You ain't nothin' but a motherfucker.\") Presley, always on the lookout for hillbilly/R&B crossover possibilities, added the song to his stage act in the spring of 1956, after hearing Freddie Bell and the Bellboys sing it in Las Vegas. On June 5th of that year, his hip-swiveling performance of \"Hound Dog\" on The Milton Berle Show became an instant sensation \u2014 notorious enough that on his next TV appearance, he crooned the song to a top-hatted basset hound. The next morning, Presley and his band got deadly serious about \"Hound Dog,\" perfecting it over 31 takes at New York's RCA Studios. With snarling vocal authority, D.J. Fontana's tommy-gun drumrolls and slashing guitar by Scotty Moore, Presley transformed the song's blues changes and put-down rhymes into a declaration of independence from his generation's cold, rigid elders. \"Hound Dog\" was the flip side of \"Don't Be Cruel,\" Presley's third RCA single. It was also the song in which he told the world: Like it or not, rock & roll is here to stay.",

        "description": "Inspired by the church-born soul of Aretha Franklin, an anxious Paul McCartney started writing \"Let It Be\" in 1968, during the contentious sessions for the White Album. His opening lines \u2014 \"When I find myself in times of trouble/Mother Mary comes to me\" \u2014 were based on a dream in which his own late mother, Mary, offered solace during a tumultuous time for both the band and the culture, assuring him that everything would turn out fine. \"I'm not sure if she used the words 'Let it be,'\" McCartney recalled, \"but that was the gist of her advice.\" McCartney unveiled a skeletal version of \"Let It Be\" to the other Beatles at an even worse time: during the initial, disastrous Let It Be rehearsals in January 1969. John Lennon, the group's resident heretic, was brutally dismissive, mistaking McCartney's secular humanism for self-righteous piety. Yet the Beatles put special labor into the song, getting the consummate take on January 31st \u2014 the day after their last live performance, on the roof of their Apple offices in London. (R&B musician Billy Preston, a friend of the band's from its early days, contributed the gospel-flavored organ part.) George Harrison later took a couple of cracks at adding a guitar solo: The single version features his solo from April 30th, 1969, and the album cut's solo was taped at the final Beatles recording session, on January 4th, 1970. Released four months later, \"Let It Be\" effectively became an elegy for the band that had defined the Sixties.",

Over eight minutes, the song morphs into a furious Page solo that storms heaven's gate. Page said the song \"crystallized the essence of the band. It had everything there and showed us at our best. It was a milestone. Every musician wants to do something of lasting quality, something which will hold up for a long time. We did it with 'Stairway.'\"",

Instead, for his first RCA single, Presley recorded this gloomy, downtempo number, co-written by Axton, his former publicist, and inspired by a Miami Herald report of a suicide note that consisted solely of the line \"I walk a lonely street.\" But what Sun Records founder Sam Phillips called \"a morbid mess\" went on to become Presley's first Number One hit and million-selling single, thanks to Scotty Moore's steely guitar leads, a thumping bass line from Bill Black and the brilliant melodrama with which Elvis infused every line.",

An early title for the song was \"Wings for Wheels,\" which resurfaced as the name of a Born to Run documentary. Decades later, Springsteen would marvel that he wrote the line \"You're scared, and you're thinking that maybe we ain't that young anymore\" when he was all of 24 years old.",

The lyrics, which celebrate risk-taking, came out of a conversation Cee-Lo and Danger Mouse had in the studio: The pair decided that their genre-smashing collaborations were indeed \"crazy.\" With a haunting melody inspired by spaghetti Western soundtrack-composer Ennio Morricone, \"Crazy\" didn't feel like a hit. \"It seemed too out there for urban radio and too urban for rock radio,\" Danger Mouse told Rolling Stone.",

Eventually, Bowie fans adopted it as the theme song for the man who'd already given them Hippie Bowie, Mod Bowie and Bluesy Bowie. As it turned out, he had barely begun to show the world his wardrobe of disguises. The poignant sax solo at the end is played by Bowie himself.Appears on: Hunky Dory (Virgin)",
